# learning-log
Welcome to my personal learning log. This repository tracks my progress through the Scientific Computing with Python certification on freeCodeCamp (https://www.freecodecamp.org/) as well as my journey into data and software develpment.

My objective
To build strong python foundations by completing beginner-level projects, coding challenges, and exercises - with clear documentation of what I have learned.
