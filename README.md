Welcome! This repository is a personal record of my journey into Python programming, created as part of my transition from biomedical science into the tech and data space.

I'm currently using:
- [FreeCodeCamp: Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/)
- JupyterLite for lightweight in-browser coding practice

## ðŸ’¡ What This Project Covers

So far, Iâ€™ve explored:
- Creating and using variables
- Strings and indexing
- The `print()` function
- Checking string length with `len()`
- Determining data types using `type()`
- Locating characters using `.find()`

Why Iâ€™m Doing This

As a Biomedical Science graduate, Iâ€™m passionate about how data and technology intersect with science and healthcare. This repo helps me build the foundations in Python, sharpen my logic, and prepare for data-driven roles or further studies.
